Research Question:

How do different factors affect the risk of a stroke?


Research:

Stroke is the leading cause of long-term adult disability and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. Risk-factors can be categorized as modifiable and non-modifiable. Knowing what these factors are can be beneficial in preventing stoke by encouraging changes to modifiable risk-factors. It could also help to decrease the fatality of strokes if people are aware of their risk. 

A case-control study in 22 countries found that 90% of the risk of stroke are associated with 10 risk factors: hypertension, current smoking, waist-to-hip ratio, diet risk score, regular physical activity, diabetes mellitus, binge alcohol consumption, psychosocial stress and depression, cardiac disease, and ratio of apolipoprotein B to A1.

As for non-modifiable risk factors, risk of stroke increases with age. Whites have a lower risk of stroke, although it is unclear whether this is due to increased risk factors or disparities in healthcare. Women also have a higher risk of stroke, although this may be because female-specific risk factors are often not considered.

Risk scoring systems have been created to help identify patients with the greatest risk of stroke which could then help with prevention. The Framingham Stroke Risk Profile is a widely-used system, and the ASCVD risk estimatorÂ was the first to consider large amounts of data from black people.
